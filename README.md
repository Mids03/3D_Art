# 3D_Art

This repository contains the final renders from the project 3D Art Develpoment by Gamedev Club
The project started with basic sculpting and coloring of the models followed by creating our own textures and applying them on the models
Next we learnt how to create a basic scene and magane the lighting in order to achieve the best results from a model
The project ended with us creating an animated scene that included all our prior knowledge of 3D model creation
