# 3D Art Development Project

Welcome to the 3D Art Development project repository, brought to you by the Gamedev Club! This repository showcases the final renders and outcomes of our immersive journey into the world of 3D art creation.

## Project Overview

The 3D Art Development project embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the 3D art creation process, guided by the talented members of the Gamedev Club. The project unfolded in several phases, each contributing to the overall mastery of 3D modeling and animation.

## Key Phases

1. **Basic Sculpting and Coloring:**
   - We initiated the project by mastering the fundamentals of sculpting and coloring 3D models.
   - Participants gained hands-on experience in shaping and coloring their creations to bring them to life.

2. **Texture Creation and Application:**
   - Building on the basics, we delved into the world of textures.
   - Participants learned how to create unique textures and apply them to their models, enhancing visual richness.

3. **Scene Creation and Lighting Management:**
   - Moving beyond individual models, we explored the intricacies of creating a cohesive scene.
   - Understanding the nuances of lighting became crucial as we aimed for optimal visual results.

4. **Animated Scene Creation:**
   - The project reached its climax with the creation of animated scenes.
   - Participants incorporated their cumulative knowledge to craft dynamic and captivating 3D scenes.
