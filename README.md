# 3D_Art

This repository contains the final renders from the project 3D Art Development by Gamedev Club\
The project started with basic sculpting and coloring of the models, followed by creating our own textures and applying them to the models\
Next, we learned how to create a basic scene and manage the lighting in order to achieve the best results from a model\
The project ended with us creating an animated scene that included all our prior knowledge of 3D model creation\
